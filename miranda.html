		<h2>Francisco de Miranda</h2>

		<p>Sebastian Francisco de Miranda y Rodriguez de Espinoza (March 28, 1750 - July 14, 1816), commonly known as Francisco de Miranda, was a Venezuelan revolutionary. Although his own plans for the independence of the Spanish American colonies failed, he is regarded as a forerunner of <strong>Simon Bolivar</strong>, who during the Spanish American wars of independence successfully liberated a vast portion of South America. Miranda led a romantic and adventurous life. An idealist, he developed a visionary plan to liberate and unify all of Spanish America but his own military initiatives on behalf of an independent Spanish America ended in 1812. He was handed over to his enemies and four years later, in 1816, died in a Spanish prison. <em>Within fourteen years of his death, however, most of Spanish America was independent.</em></p>

		<h2>Early Life</h2>
		<p>Sebastian Francisco de Miranda was born in Caracas, Venezuela Province, in the Spanish colonial Viceroyalty of New Granada, and baptized on April 5, 1750. His father, Sebastian de Miranda Ravelo, was an immigrant from the Canary Islands who had become a successful and wealthy merchant, and his mother, Francisca Antonia Rodriguez de Espinoza, was a wealthy Venezuelan.</p>
		<p>Growing up, Miranda enjoyed a wealthy upbringing, and attended the finest private schools. However, Miranda was not necessarily a member of high society growing up- he faced some discrimination due to his Canarian roots, and his heritage was continually put into question by the Criollo aristocracy.
		</p>

		<h2>Education</h2>
		<p>Miranda's father, Sebastian, always strove to improve the situation of the family, and in addition to accumulating wealth and attaining important positions, he ensured his children a college education. Miranda was first tutored by Jesuits, Jorge Lindo and Juan Santaella, before entering the Academy of Santa Rosa. </p>
		<p>On January 10, 1762, Miranda began his studies at the Royal and Pontifical University of Caracas, where he studied Latin, the early grammar of Nebrija and the Catechism of Ripalda for two years. Miranda completed this preliminary course in September of 1764 and became an upperclassmen. Between 1764-1766, Miranda continued his studies, studying the writings of Cicero and Virgil, grammar, history, religion, geography and arithmetic.</p>
		<p>In June of 1767, Miranda received his baccalaureate degree in the Humanities. It's unknown if Miranda received the title of Doctor, as the only evidence in favor of this title is his personal testimony stating he received it in 1767, at age 17.</p>

		<h2>Issues of Ethnic Lineage</h2>
		<p>However, beginning in 1767, Miranda's studies were disrupted in part due to his father's rising prominence in Caracas society. In 1764, Sebastian de Miranda was appointed the captain of the local militia known as the Company of the White Canary Islanders by the governor, Jose de Solano y Bote. Sebastian de Miranda directed his regiment for five years, but his new title and societal position bothered the Mantuanos. In retaliation, a competing faction formed a militia of its own and local aristocrats, Don Juan Nicolas de ponte and Don Martin Tovar Blanco filed a complaint against Sebastian de Miranda. Sebastian de Miranda requested and was granted honorary military discharge to avoid further antagonizing the local elite, and spent many years attempting to clear the family name and establish the "purity" of his family line. In 1769, Sebastian produced a notarized genealogy to prove that his family had no African ancestors. The need to establish the "purity" of the family bloodline was important to maintain a place in society in Caracas, as it was what allowed the family to attend University, to marry in the church, and to attain government positions.</p>
		<p>In 1770, Sebastian won his family's rights through an official Royal Patent, signed by Charles III which confirmed Sebastian's title and societal standing. The court ruling, however, created an irreconcilable enmity with the Mantuanos, who never forgot the conflict nor forgave the challenge, which inevitably influenced subsequent decisions by Miranda.</p>
		<p>After the court victory of his father, Miranda left Caracas to pursue a new life in Spain, and on January 25, 1771, Miranda left Caracas from the port of La Guaira for Cadiz, Spain, on the Swedish frigate, the Prince Frederick.</p>

		<h2>First Travels</h2>
		<p>In 1771, Miranda began a long journey around the world that lasted most of his life. He described his experiences over this time in his journal, which reached to 63 bound volumes. He participated in three major historical and political movements of his time: American Revolutionary War, French Revolution and Spanish American wars of independence.</p>
		<p>Miranda landed at the Port of Cadiz on March 1, 1771, and stayed for a few days with a distant relative, Jose D'Anino and after two weeks in Cadiz, Miranda left for Madrid. In Madrid, Miranda pursued his education, especially modern languages, as they would allow him to travel throughout Europe.</p>
		<p>He conceived the idea of Latin American unity during his travels. He fought bravely in America, Europe and Africa, though he thought Sepoy bring India-ran and traveled throughout Europe, Asia Minor, North America, South America and the Antilles. He met many important figures, including George Washington, Napoleon Bonaparte, Simon Bolivar, Catherine the Great, Frederick II of Prussia, the Duke of Wellington, Jose de San Martin, Robert Peel, La Fayette, Stanislaw Poniatowski, William Pitt, Grigori Alexandrovich Potemkin, Thomas Cochrane, Samuel Adams and Johann Caspar Lavater.</p>
		<p>He was influenced by his relationships with Hispanic personalities including San Martin, Andres Bello, Bernardo O'Higgins, Carlos Montúfar, Carlos Maria de Alvear, Servando Teresa de Mier, Domingo Jose Martins, Manuel Palacio Fajardo, Juan German Roscio, Manuel Gual and Pedro Gual, Hipolito Costa, Jose Bonifacio de Andrada e Silva, Matias de Irigoyen and Rodriguez Pena.</p>
		<p>Miranda was directly involved in the French Revolution for which he was awarded the title Hero of the Revolution and Marshal of France. He is the only American engraved on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.</p>

		<h2>Expeditions in South America, the First Venezuelan Republic, and death (1806-1816)</h2>
		<p>His life has long been associated with the struggle of the Spanish colonies in Latin America for independence. Miranda envisioned an independent empire consisting of all the territories that had been under Spanish and Portuguese rule, stretching from the Mississippi River to Cape Horn. This empire was to be under the leadership of a hereditary emperor called the "Inca", in honor of the great Inca Empire, and would have a bicameral legislature. He conceived the name Colombia for this empire, after the explorer Christopher Columbus.</p>
		<p>With informal British help, Miranda led an attempted invasion of the Captaincy General of Venezuela in 1806. At the time Britain was at war with Spain, an ally of Napoleon. In November 1805 Miranda travelled to New York, where he rekindled his acquaintance with Colonel William S. Smith, who introduced him to merchant Samuel G. Ogden (who would later be tried, but acquitted, for helping organize Miranda's expedition). Miranda then went to Washington for private meetings with President Thomas Jefferson and his Secretary of State James Madison, who met with Miranda but did not involve themselves or their nation in his plans, which would have been a violation of the Proclamation of Neutrality of 1793. Miranda privately began organizing a filibustering expedition to liberate Venezuela. Among the volunteers who served under him in this revolt was David G. Burnet of the United States, who would later serve as interim president of the Republic of Texas after its secession from Mexico in 1836. Miranda hired a ship from Ogden, which he rebaptized the Leander in honor of his oldest son.</p>
		<p>In Jacmel, Haiti, Miranda acquired two other ships, the Bee and the Bacchus, and their crews. It is here in Jacmel on March 12, when Miranda made, and raised on the Leander, the first Venezuelan flag, which he had personally designed. On April 28 the small fleet was overtaken by Spanish war ships off the coast of Venezuela. Only the Leander escaped. Sixty men were captured and put on trial, and ten were sentenced to death. Leander and the expeditionary force regrouped on the British islands of Barbados and Trinidad, assisted by HMS Lilly. The expedition landed at La Vela de Coro on August 3, captured the fort and raised the flag for the first time on Venezuelan soil. Before dawn the next morning the expeditionaries occupied Coro, but found no support from the city residents. Rather than risk a defeat, the small royal force in the city fell back from the city escorting refugees and to await reinforcements. Realizing that he could not hold the city for long, Miranda ordered his force to set sail again on August 13, and he spent the next year in the British Caribbean waiting for reinforcements that never came. On his return to Britain, he was met with better support for his plans from the British government. In 1808 a large military force to attack Venezuela was assembled and placed under the command of Arthur Wellesley, but Napoleon's invasion of Spain suddenly transformed Spain into an ally of Britain, and the force instead went there to fight in the Peninsular War.</p>

		<h2>The First Republic of Venezuela</h2>
		<p>Venezuela achieved de facto independence on April 19, 1810, when the Supreme Junta of Caracas was established and the colonial administrators deposed. The Junta sent a delegation to Great Britain to get British recognition and aid. This delegation, which included future Venezuelan notables Simon Bolivar and Andres Bello, met with and persuaded Miranda to return to his native land. In 1811 a delegation from the Supreme Junta, among them Bolivar, and a crowd of common people enthusiastically received Miranda in La Guaira. In Caracas he agitated for the provisional government to declare independence from Spain under rule of Joseph Bonaparte. Miranda gathered around him a group of similarly-minded individuals and helped establish an association, la Sociedad Patriotica, modeled on the political clubs of the French Revolution. By the end of the year the Venezuelan provinces elected a congress to deal with the future of the country, and Miranda was chosen as the delegate from El Pao, Barcelona Province. On July 5, 1811, it formally declared Venezuelan independence and established a republic. The congress also adopted his tricolor as the Republic's flag.</p>
		<p>The following year Miranda and the young Republic's fortunes turned. Republican forces failed to subdue areas of Venezuela (provinces of Coro, Maracaibo and Guyana) which had remained royalist. In addition, Venezuela's loss of the Spanish market for its main export, cocoa meant that an economic crisis set in, which mostly hurt the middle and lower classes, who lost enthusiasm for the Republic. Finally a powerful earthquake and its aftershocks hit the country, which caused large numbers of deaths and serious damage to buildings, mostly in republican areas. It did not help that it hit on March 26, 1812, as services for Maundy Thursday were beginning. The Caracas Junta had been established on a Maundy Thursday as well, so the earthquake fell on its second anniversary in the liturgical calendar. This was interpreted by many as a sign from Providence. Since the earthquake occurred on Maundy Thursday, while the Venezuelan War of Independence was raging, it was explained by royalist authorities as divine punishment for the rebellion against the Spanish Crown. The archbishop of Caracas, Narciso Coll y Prat, referred to the event as "the terrifying but well-deserved earthquake" which "confirms in our days the prophecies revealed by God to men about the ancient impious and proud cities: Babylon, Jerusalem and the Tower of Babel". Many, including those in the Republican army, and the majority of the clergy, began to secretly plot against the Republic or outright defect. Other provinces refused to send reinforcements to Caracas Province. Worse still, whole provinces began to switch sides. On July 4, an uprising brought Barcelona over to the royalist side.</p>
		<p>Neighboring Cumana, now cut off from the Republican center, refused to recognize Miranda's dictatorial powers and his appointment of a commandant general. By the middle of the month many of the outlying areas of Cumana Province had also defected to the royalists. With these circumstances a Spanish marine frigate captain, Domingo Monteverde, operating out of Coro, was able to turn a small force under his command into a large army, as people joined him on his advance towards Valencia, leaving Miranda in charge of only a small area of central Venezuela. In these dire circumstances Miranda was given broad political powers by his government. By mid-July Monteverde had taken Valencia, and Miranda thought the situation was hopeless. He started negotiations with Monteverde and finalized an armistice on July 25, 1812. He then went to the port of La Guaira intending to leave on a British ship before the royalists arrived, although under the armistice there was an amnesty for political offenses. Then-Colonel Bolivar and other revolutionary officers claimed his actions as treasonous. Bolivar and the others arrested and handed Miranda over to the Spanish Royal Army. Bolivar claimed afterwards that he wanted to shoot him as a traitor but was restrained by the others; Bolivar's reasoning was that "if Miranda believed the Spaniards would observe the treaty, he should have remained to keep them to their word; if he did not, he was a traitor to have sacrificed his army to it." Ironically, it was by handing over Miranda to the Spanish that Bolivar assured himself a passport from the Spanish authorities (passports which, nevertheless, had been guaranteed to all republicans who requested them by the terms of the armistice), which allowed him to leave Venezuela unmolested.</p>

		<p>Miranda never saw freedom again. His case was still being processed, when he died in a prison cell at the Penal de las Cuatro Torres at the Arsenal de la Carraca, outside Cadiz, aged 66. He was buried in a mass grave, making it impossible to identify his remains, so an empty tomb has been left for him in the National Pantheon of Venezuela.</p>
